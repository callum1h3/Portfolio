    <p id="text">SCP Game ----- This game is currently being worked on by me and two other friends since June 2023. We needed a long term project to help develop our skills further so we decided to make a game in the SCP universe based on other popular games such as Containment Breach however with a focus on the multiplayer aspect. I am the only programmer on this project so I was tasked with developing frameworks to intregrate all of the ideas that we want to put into the game.<br><br>So far we have been working on it for around a year and we have many features such as P2P Multiplayer (SteamNetworkingSockets), Level Streaming (Room System), Networked Entity System (Links with Level Streaming), A* Node-Based Pathfinding, Event System, Entity Interaction Framework and much more!<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46xvM4fzjNw</p>
